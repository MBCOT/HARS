Healthcare Appointment / Remainder system


- On Spain once you got an appointment to a visit's doctor, or some kind of test or blood analysis it
needs to be reminded to you at least two times, the first time and a few days before the appointment.
.
- You can ask for appointment by phone or by web, and a reminder before the appointment or any test
the doctor asked, is sent to you as sms on your phone.
- Instead of using this system, a cheaper one could be used, a Dapp could be developed, that basically
would be a Calendar related to script address unique to that user, so when an appointment or a test
is asked/required, a Token or NFT would be generated with all info and sent to the user.
- The advantage of that, is that the user could see the appointment on his Dapp and the Dapp
automatically would raised and alarm and a notify message one or two days before the appointment,
so a lot of money can be saved instead of sending hundreds of thousands of sms every day.

**----> UDPOI could be used** to generate this unique proof of identity for that case, so a user could
have different UDPOI tokens according the use they are going to give to it.
